# ASTR513-Final
Final project for ASTR513. The jupyter file shows a demonstration on how to deconvolve the stars and background galaxies of LBT image and remove the reconstructed star model from the image to leave only the background galaxies. I cannot provide the original image file I used as it is not opened yet.
